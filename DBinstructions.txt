1) download and setup a derby db. Should be installed to:

2) run the commands:
$ nohup java -jar $DERBY_HOME/lib/derbyrun.jar server start & 
$ java -jar $DERBY_HOME/lib/derbyrun.jar server sysinfo

The database is now setup. To use in the project, we need to 
only change the stuff in context.xml to match what we filled in 
in the properties tab.

4) context.xml is located in META-INF. configure: url, username, and password
